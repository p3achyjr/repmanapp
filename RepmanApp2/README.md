This is the companion app to Repman, a wristband that counts your reps and sets, signals when you are done, counts your rest period, and signals when your rest period is over.

This connects to a set Bean in the background, and then allows the user to input exercise parameters. Upon pressing upload, the app sends a string to the Bean, which the Bean then reads.
